# Multiples of 3 or 5
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with `1` and `2`, the first terms will be:
<p style="text-align: center;">1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89,...</p>
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
